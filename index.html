<p>
There are many different classes of drugs, all of which can pose danger to those who choose to abuse substances within those classes. All drugs are not created equal. Infact, some drugs have the potential to be deadliers than others based on how they are developed, what they contain, and how potent they are. Some of the most common types of drug abuse include the following . . .

	Adolescents prefer an autonomous and independent life that is free from adult control, there by engaging in various delinquent acts (drug abuse, rape, robbery, cultism and vandalism) that are dangerous to the home, community, school and the nation. The impact of drug abuse among adolescents has been a stigma of moral decadence, violence, thugery, assault, madness and murder.
	<br><br>

	The goal of reducing drug abuse has shaped some of the U.S. government’s most uncompromising policies. From the strict surveillance of the U.S.- Mexican border to national antidrug advertising campaigns, federal efforts to reduce drug abuse have relentlessly targeted the supply and demand of illicit drugs. Many of these tactics, including the harsh punishment of drug dealers and habitual drug users, are punitive in nature. 
	<br><br>

	However, the argument that drug abuse is a public health issue, rather than a criminal activity, has renewed the debate over existing drug policies. For instance, the theory that drug addiction is a neurological disorder, not a moral flaw, has caused some to view addicts less as criminals and more as sick individuals who need treatment and compassion. Also, “harm reduction,” an approach that focuses not on preventing drug abuse, but instead on reducing the risks associated with drug use, is gaining attention as an alternative to America’s hard line drug policies. Advocates of harm reduction assert that a practical and nonjudgmental approach in confronting drug abuse is more effective than disciplinary action.
<br><br>
	Harm reduction is based on three pragmatic central beliefs. 
	The first belief is that “excessive behaviors occur along a continuum”; the moderate use of substances causes less harm than abuse. <br><br>
	The second belief is that; changing addictive behavior is a stepwise process, complete abstinence being the final step. He explains that the harm reduction model “embraces” any movement away from the harms of drug use, no matter how small.
<br><br>
	The third belief, is that “sobriety simply isn’t for everybody” and that drug abuse is a fact of life for some individuals.
